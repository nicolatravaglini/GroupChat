CURRENT VERSION: 1.3.3
Down here you can find the BUGS to resolve, and the IDEAS to improve to the code.


BUGS:
Sometimes the messages are formed only by the sender, and not you they unlock even by activating the Reading News mode;

IDEAS:
Implement a list of rooms you can enter, with relative password;

Insert the buttons to be able to go back (in the screens previous);

Implement file encryption algorithm;

Insert the application icon on each screen;

For the server side, implement the graphical interface, which allows to enter the door code to gain access and the address Public IP to access; obviously do the same thing for the side as well client;

Implement a startup screen with logo animation;
