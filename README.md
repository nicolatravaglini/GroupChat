# GroupChat
A new server-client open-source messaging application written entirely in Python.

CURRENT VERSION: 1.5.3
Down here you can find the BUGS to resolve, and the IDEAS to improve to the code.


BUGS:
Sometimes the messages are formed only by the sender, and not you they unlock even by activating the Reading News mode;

IDEAS:
Insert the buttons to be able to go back (in the screens previous);

Implement file encryption algorithm;

Insert the application icon on each screen;

Implement a startup screen with logo animation;

A unique window with all you need (the login screen will be for only the first time, for configurations file saving)
